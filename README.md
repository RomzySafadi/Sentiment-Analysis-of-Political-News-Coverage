Sentiment Analysis of Political News Coverage: Topic Modeling and a Comparative Study of Vectorization Methods and Machine Learning  Classification Algorithms

Abstract

The overwhelming volume of digital news published online every hour of the day poses
a significant and practical challenge to political campaign managers who need to monitor how
political interest topics are being framed by news outlets. This is particularly important leading
up to a Presidential campaign when it is critical for a campaign team to respond quickly and
strategically to editorial commentary and headlines. This problem can be addressed through
topic modeling and implementing a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and
machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to classify the sentiment of digital news
coverage.  In this paper, we conduct topic clustering and modeling with k-means and LDA,
respectively. We also undertake a comparative analysis of three different NLP techniques, Bag-
of-Words (BoW), TF-IDF and Doc2Vec, combined with three different ML classification
algorithms, logistic regression, SVM, and naïve bayes, on a corpus of 44 news articles from both
left-leaning and right-leaning news outlets. This paper reviews the relative accuracy of each
combination of vectorization technique and ML algorithm. The best combinations, namely
Naïve Bayes and SVM utilizing BoW techniques, delivered an accuracy of 86%.
